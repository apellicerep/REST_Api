# REST API
In this project, I've created a REST API using Express. The API will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

I've used my knowledge of REST API design, Node.js, and Express to create:

* API routes
* Data modeling with Sequelize ORM
* Basic Authentication
* Validation
* Data persistence (SQL)
* Postman for testing the REST API.

In a future project, I'll complete a full stack JavaScript application by using React to create a client for this REST API.
